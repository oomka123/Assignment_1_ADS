Recursive Algorithms in Java

This project contains various recursive algorithms implemented in Java. The program allows users to select and execute different algorithms while measuring their execution time with high precision.

Features:

1)Find the minimum element in an array

2)Calculate the sum and average of array elements

3)Check if a number is prime

4)Compute factorials

5)Generate Fibonacci numbers

6)Perform exponentiation

7)Reverse an array recursively

8)Check if a string consists only of digits

9)Compute the binomial coefficient

10)Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm

Usage:

The program prompts the user to select and execute different algorithms. Each function measures execution time in milliseconds using System.nanoTime().

Code Structure:

Main.java: Contains the main method and user interaction logic.

Algorithms.java: Houses recursive methods.

Example Output

Enter the size of the array: 5
Enter the array elements: 3 1 4 1 5
Minimum element of the array: 1
Time taken: 0.002 milliseconds
